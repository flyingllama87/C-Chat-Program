### TCP/Sockets realtime chat program in C

Implementation of real-time TCP chat client & server for windows & POSIX systems using winsock/sockets lib & pthreads.

Requires MINGW on windows for pthreads support/lib.  Requires winsock2 lib.

I try to handle errors in user input gracefully.  Another goal of this project was to fix every compiler warning.

What I learned:
- Sockets/winsock
- Validating used input
- pthreads
- C can be tedious
